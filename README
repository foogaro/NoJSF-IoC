NoJSF - It is a basic project which aims to be the base for projects that do NOT want to use any obtrusive frontend frameworks.
This variant is based on the IoC pattern provided by Spring.
The project uses RESTeasy for the REST layer and Spring 3 to provide injection between layers.

So, if all you want is just html, js, css and a restful backend... you found what you were looking for.

This is how it works:
 - the user acts on the client sending an ajax request;
 - the REST controller (aka restler) intercepts the request and delegates it to the business layer;
 - the effective business component does the hard work and, if necessary, asks the persistence layer to query or persist entities/documents;
 - the persistence component goes directly to the database through the appropriate and provided driver.
The chain terminates with a HTTP code, hopefully a 200 or 201 code! ;)
